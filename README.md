# DuplexPCB

This action plugin tries to create the second part of the duplex PCB.<br>

## Install
Just copy the teardrop folder into the KiCad plugins directory, then restart KiCad. The DuplexPCB plugin should now be available in the Tools/External plugin menu.

## Usage
To duplicate existing PCB you need to create a mapping file first. It must be a simple text file with mapping for all components you want to duplicate.
